# RF-RoboticHand
Arduino code for RadioFrequency-controlled robotic hand with a glove with flex sensors.

Check out the video here: https://vimeo.com/248898398

The glove has flex sensors made from scratch. It has a circuit that transmit the values of the flex sensors via Radio Frequency.
The robotic Hand has a circuit that reads the flex sensors values and actuates the servos, emulating the movement of the glove.
